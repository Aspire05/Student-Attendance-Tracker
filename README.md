Technical Implementation
The application is built with:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 with modern features (custom variables, flexbox, gradients, subtle animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript for functionality and DOM manipulation
- LocalStorage API for client-side data persistence

The UI features a clean, modern design with a color scheme based around indigo and purple gradients. The interface includes thoughtful details such as color-coded attendance states, progress bars for visual tracking, and interactive elements with hover effects.


Design Philosophy
- The application embraces a minimalist yet functional approach, prioritizing usability while maintaining visual appeal. The interface uses subtle shadows, rounded corners, and a carefully selected color palette to create a professional and engaging user experience.
  
This project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts including:
- User input handling and validation
- Dynamic rendering of UI elements
- Client-side data storage and retrieval
- Responsive design principles
